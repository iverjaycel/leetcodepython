    "### List \n",
    "list is a collection of items, and it's one of the most commonly used data structures. Lists are versatile and can hold elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are ordered, meaning the order of items in a list is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of how to work with lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a List**:\n",
    "   You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Elements**:\n",
    "   Elements in a list are accessed using index numbers. The first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   first_element = my_list[0]  # Accesses the first element (1)\n",
    "   third_element = my_list[2]  # Accesses the third element (3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modifying Elements**:\n",
    "   You can change the value of an element in a list by assigning a new value to a specific index.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list[1] = 10  # Changes the second element to 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appending and Inserting Elements**:\n",
    "   You can add elements to the end of a list using the `append()` method. You can also insert elements at a specific position using the `insert()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list.append(6)       # Adds 6 to the end\n",
    "   my_list.insert(1, 7)    # Inserts 7 at index 1, shifting other elements\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Removing Elements**:\n",
    "   You can remove elements by value using the `remove()` method or by index using the `del` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list.remove(3)   # Removes the element with value 3\n",
    "   del my_list[0]      # Removes the first element\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Popping Elements**:\n",
    "   The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element by default. You can also provide an index to remove and return an element at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   popped_item = my_list.pop()  # Removes and returns the last element\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Other List Methods**:\n",
    "   There are various other methods like `index()`, `count()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, and more that allow you to manipulate and manage lists in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **List Length**:\n",
    "   You can find the number of elements in a list using the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   length = len(my_list)  # Returns the number of elements in the list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are fundamental data structures in Python, offering a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of items."

    "9. **`copy()`**: Creates a shallow copy of the list.\n",
    "10. **`clear()`**: Removes all items from the list.\n",

    "12. **`index(item, start, end)`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item within the specified range of indices.\n",
    "13. **`count(item)`**: Returns the number of occurrences of the specified item in the list.\n",
    "14. **`sort(key=None, reverse=False)`**: Sorts the list in ascending order using an optional sorting key function and reverse order flag.\n",
    "15. **`reverse()`**: Reverses the order of the items in the list.\n",
    "16. **`copy()`**: Creates a shallow copy of the list.\n",
    "17. **`clear()`**: Removes all items from the list.\n",
    "18. **`extend(iterable)`**: Adds elements from an iterable (e.g., another list) to the end of the list.\n",
